# Audio Visualizer
This is a project to see if I can make a little python app that will listen with my computer microphone, then plot, in real time, the wave it is hearing, as well as a frequency diagram. This is an opportunity to explore real time processing, Fourier Transforms, and a bit more Python. 

## How?
I see the components of the project as follows: <br>
- Connect to the microphone <br>
- Process/understand audio file <br>
- Fourier Transform into spectrogram <br>
- Show data in real time <br>
